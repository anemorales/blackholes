        <h1>Black Holes:From Biggest to Smallest</h1>
        <p>Can a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/">black holes</a> destroy our galaxy?</p>

        <h2>What is a black hole?</h2>   
        <p>A black hole is large amounts of matter compressed into a smaller area. Black holes are created by the explosion of a supernova (giant star). The density of black holes is what causes anything in its path to be sucked in.</p>

        <h3>Why should I know more about black holes?</h3>
        <p>Black holes are prominent in space and our own galaxy has one. Perhaps it can clarify why certain parts of space have not been explored. Or what happens after a star explodes? How was the earth created? The history of black holes and how it is created can help answer these questions. It can help also describe how space and time work</p>
